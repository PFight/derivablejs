## 0.4.2

Cyclical graph structures disallowed again. They are nice but incompatible with
havelock's central tenets of laziness, consistency, and automatic memory management.

## 0.4.1

Cyclical graph structures now allowed. You get stack overflows if you make an
infinitely-repeating cycle.

## 0.4.0

- `transaction`-ized functions can now return a value
- `struct` only accepts plain objects and arrays
- `defaultEquals` exposed for use when writing custom equality-checking functions.

## 0.3.2

.d.ts reinstated

## 0.3.1

Fix transaction abortion sweep bug.

## 0.3.0

- Fallback to ES5 for implementation. Babel was doing weird junk and I don't want
to have to deal with that again.
- Introduce `transaction` function. no api docs yet.

## 0.2.3

Fixed parent management bug for disowned children.

## 0.2.2

Switched to Apache 2.0 license.

## 0.2.1

sorted out npm module to only include dist.

## 0.2.0

- changed behaviour of method `Derivable::derive` to work like `swap` in terms
  of arguments. e.g. now you can do `let five = three.derive(plus, two)`;
- changed function `derive` to match. i.e. it is now just a functional interface
  to the method.
- new function `derivation(f)` which does what `derive(f)` used to do.
